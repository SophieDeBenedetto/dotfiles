# Configurations

# GIT_MERGE_AUTO_EDIT
# This variable configures git to not require a message when you merge.

# Editors
# Tells your shell that when a program requires various editors, use sublime.
# The -w flag tells your shell to wait until sublime exits

# Version
# What version of the Flatiron School bash profile this is
export FLATIRON_VERSION='1.1.1'
# Paths

# The USR_PATHS variable will just store all relevant /usr paths for easier usage
# Each path is seperate via a : and we always use absolute paths.

# A bit about the /usr directory
# The /usr directory is a convention from linux that creates a common place to put
# files and executables that the entire system needs access too. It tries to be user
# independent, so whichever user is logged in should have permissions to the /usr directory.
# We call that /usr/local. Within /usr/local, there is a bin directory for actually
# storing the binaries (programs) that our system would want.
# Also, Homebrew adopts this convetion so things installed via Homebrew
# get symlinked into /usr/local
export USR_PATHS="/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin"

# Hint: You can interpolate a variable into a string by using the $VARIABLE notation as below.

# We build our final PATH by combining the variables defined above
# along with any previous values in the PATH variable.

# Our PATH variable is special and very important. Whenever we type a command into our shell,
# it will try to find that command within a directory that is defined in our PATH.
# Read http://blog.seldomatt.com/blog/2012/10/08/bash-and-the-one-true-path/ for more on that.
export PATH="$USR_PATHS:$PATH:/Users/sophie.debenedetto/.mix/escripts"
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"

# RVM
# Mandatory loading of RVM into the shell
# This must be the last line of your bash_profile always
[[ -s "/Users/$USER/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "/Users/$USER/.rvm/scripts/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.
